# Getting Started

Setting up a consistent and reproducible development environment is crucial for conducting reproducible research.

This guide provides an overview of the essential components needed for a robust research environment.

## Overview

To establish a productive research environment, you'll need to set up three key components:

1. **Python Environment Management** - Tools to manage Python installations, packages, and virtual environments
2. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** - Software to write, debug, and manage your code effectively
3. **Version Control System** - Tools to track changes, collaborate, and ensure reproducibility

## Quick Start Guide

For detailed instructions on each component, please refer to the dedicated guides:

### 1. Python Environment Management
**→ [Python Management Guide](python_management.md)**

Learn how to set up and manage Python environments using:
- **Conda** - Popular for scientific computing with pre-compiled packages
- **uv** - Fast, modern Python package manager written in Rust
- **Poetry** - Sophisticated dependency management and packaging tool

Choose the tool that best fits your workflow and project requirements.

### 2. IDE Setup
**→ [IDE Setup Guide](ide_setup.md)**

Configure your development environment with:
- **PyCharm** - Full-featured Python IDE with advanced debugging and analysis
- **Visual Studio Code** - Lightweight, extensible editor with excellent Python support
- **Jupyter** - Interactive notebook environment for exploratory research

Each IDE offers unique advantages depending on your coding style and project needs.

### 3. Version Control
**→ [Version Control Guide](version_control.md)**

Master Git and GitHub for:
- Tracking changes in your research code
- Collaborating with team members
- Ensuring reproducible research practices
- Managing project history and releases

Version control is essential for maintaining research integrity and enabling collaboration.

## Recommended Setup Path

For new researchers, we recommend this setup sequence:

1. **Start with Python Management**: Choose and install one environment manager (Conda is often easiest for beginners)
2. **Set up your IDE**: Install and configure either PyCharm or VS Code based on your preferences
3. **Initialize Version Control**: Set up Git and create your first repository on GitHub
4. **Create your first project**: Apply all three components in a simple research project

## Integration Tips

These tools work best when used together:
- Configure your IDE to recognize your Python environments
- Set up your IDE's Git integration for seamless version control
- Use environment files (`environment.yml`, `pyproject.toml`) that are tracked in version control
- Establish consistent project structures across all your research projects

## Best Practices

### General Setup Tips

1. **Always use virtual environments** to isolate project dependencies
2. **Pin dependency versions** for reproducibility
3. **Document your environment setup** in your project README
4. **Use lock files** (`poetry.lock`, `conda-lock`) when available
5. **Keep development and production dependencies separate**
6. **Regularly update dependencies** while testing for compatibility

### Reproducibility Tips

- Include environment files (`environment.yml`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`) in version control
- Document the Python version and environment manager used
- Consider using Docker for ultimate reproducibility
- Test your environment setup on different machines

## Next Steps

Once you've completed the basic setup:

1. **Practice with a sample project** - Create a small research project to test your environment
2. **Explore advanced features** - Dive deeper into the specific tools you've chosen
3. **Join the community** - Participate in relevant online communities and forums
4. **Keep learning** - Stay updated with new tools and best practices in research computing

Remember: The goal is to create a reproducible, collaborative, and efficient research environment that supports your scientific work.
