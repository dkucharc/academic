## Course Overview

- **Name:** Machine Learning
- **Course Code:** [W13AMA-SM2338G](https://wmat.pwr.edu.pl/fcp/kGBUKOQtTKlQhbx08SlkTVwJQX2o8DAoHNiwFE1xVSHhTFVZpCFghUHcKVigEQUw/46/public/doc/dziekanat/plany_programy/2023_2024/aman/machine_learning.pdf)
- **Prerequisites:**
    - Fundamental understanding of linear algebra
    - Basic understanding of multivariable calculus concepts and optimization algorithm
    - Ability to write a non-trivial computer program in Python or equivalent
    - Working knowledge of GitHub.

## Grading Policy

- **Assignments:** 70%
- **Project:** 30%


**Grading Scale:**

| **Percents**    | **Grade**    |
|:---------------:|:------------:|
|   >90%          | 5            |
| [80%, 90%)      | 4.5          |
| [70%, 80%)      | 4            |
| [60%, 70%)      | 3.5          |
| [50%, 60%)      | 3            |

## Assignments and Projects

- Weekly programming assignments due every Wednesday by 11:59 PM.
- Late submissions: 10% penalty per day, up to 3 days
- Final project proposal and team formation (max. 3 persons) due Week 8 (**21st of November, 2024**),
- Final project presentation during the last week of classes (**30rd of January, 2025**),

## Academic Integrity

- All submitted work must be original
- Collaboration on assignments is encouraged, but submitted code must be individual work
- Plagiarism or cheating will result in a failing grade for the assignment and possible disciplinary action

## Attendance Policy

- Attendance **is not** mandatory for all lectures and lab sessions
