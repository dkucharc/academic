# Week #10 - Convolutional Neural Networks - Architecture Review

In today's lecture, we'll dive into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their foundational role in computer vision. We'll explore how these specialized architectures leverage spatial relationships in visual data, their core building blocks, and how they've revolutionized image processing tasks from classification to segmentation.
