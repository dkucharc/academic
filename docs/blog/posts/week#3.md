# Week #3 - Supervised Machine Learning
  

<!-- more -->

**Learning objectives:**

- Formalize the supervised machine learning setup, including understanding the concepts of training data, feature spaces, label spaces, and hypothesis functions.
- Comprehend different types of classification problems (binary, multi-class) and regression, along with their corresponding label spaces and feature vector characteristics.
- Understand the process of learning a hypothesis function, including selecting an appropriate algorithm and finding the best function within the hypothesis class using loss functions.
- Grasp the concept of generalization and the importance of train/test splits to address overfitting concerns, including the role of validation data in model development.
- Learn how to properly train and evaluate a classifier, including the formulas for minimizing training loss and calculating testing loss, as well as understanding how these relate to the true generalization loss.
