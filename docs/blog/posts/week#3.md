# Week #3 - Supervised Machine Learning
  
In this class, we'll explore the core principles of supervised machine learning. We'll cover how to represent data, formulate learning problems, and train models using mathematical frameworks. Key topics include feature spaces, hypothesis functions, loss minimization, and generalization. We'll also discuss practical aspects like data splitting and model evaluation. By the end, you'll understand how to approach a machine learning problem from formulation to implementation, providing a foundation for more advanced ML concepts.

**Learning objectives:**

- Formalize the supervised machine learning setup, including understanding the concepts of training data, feature spaces, label spaces, and hypothesis functions.
- Comprehend different types of classification problems (binary, multi-class) and regression, along with their corresponding label spaces and feature vector characteristics.
- Understand the process of learning a hypothesis function, including selecting an appropriate algorithm and finding the best function within the hypothesis class using loss functions.
- Grasp the concept of generalization and the importance of train/test splits to address overfitting concerns, including the role of validation data in model development.
- Learn how to properly train and evaluate a classifier, including the formulas for minimizing training loss and calculating testing loss, as well as understanding how these relate to the true generalization loss.
