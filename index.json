This can help to improve the performance of machine learning models by reducing the amount of noise and redundancy in the data, as well as making the data more computationally efficient to process. Some of the modern methods of dimensionality reduction include:\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a popular technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset by identifying the principal components that explain the most variance in the data. It works by projecting the data onto a new set of orthogonal axes, with each axis representing a principal component.\nt-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE): t-SNE is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that is particularly effective for visualizing high-dimensional data. It works by mapping the high-dimensional data points to a low-dimensional space, while preserving the pairwise distances between the data points.\nAutoencoders: Autoencoders are neural networks that can be used for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction. They work by compressing the input data into a lower-dimensional representation, and then reconstructing the original input from this compressed representation.\nNon-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF): NMF is a matrix factorization technique that can be used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. It works by factorizing a non-negative matrix into two non-negative matrices, where the resulting factors can be interpreted as a lower-dimensional representation of the original data.\nUMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection): UMAP is a newer technique for dimensionality reduction that is gaining popularity. It works by constructing a low-dimensional representation of the data that preserves both local and global structure, making it particularly useful for clustering and visualization tasks.\nThese modern methods of dimensionality reduction offer a range of options to choose from, and selecting the most appropriate technique for a particular dataset depends on the nature of the data and the specific goals of the analysis.\n","date":1679356800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679356800,"objectID":"f0ca8b7dedc59d1619cdde60cf990ab6","permalink":"https://dkucharc.github.io/academic/projects/dimensionality_reduction/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic/projects/dimensionality_reduction/","section":"projects","summary":"Dimensionality reduction is a technique used in machine learning to reduce the number of features in a dataset.

Hyperspectral imaging is a remote sensing technique that captures the electromagnetic radiation reflected from the Earth’s surface across hundreds of narrow spectral bands. Linear unmixing is used to extract information about the different materials present in the scene based on their spectral signatures.\nThe linear unmixing model assumes that each pixel in the hyperspectral image can be represented as a linear combination of the spectral signatures of the materials present in that pixel. In other words, the pixel’s spectrum is a weighted sum of the spectra of the constituent materials. This model is expressed mathematically as:\n𝐼(λ) = 𝑆(λ)𝐴\nwhere 𝐼(λ) is the observed spectrum at wavelength λ, 𝑆(λ) is the matrix of spectral signatures for the materials of interest, and 𝐴 is the abundance matrix that represents the proportion of each material present in the pixel.\nThe linear unmixing process involves estimating the abundance matrix 𝐴 for each pixel in the image. This is typically done using optimization techniques such as least squares, non-negative least squares, or constrained least squares. Once the abundance matrix is estimated, the abundance maps can be generated for each material, providing information about the spatial distribution of the different materials in the scene.\nLinear unmixing is widely used in applications such as mineral mapping, vegetation analysis, and urban land-use classification, among others. It is a powerful tool for extracting information from hyperspectral data and can provide valuable insights into the Earth’s surface and its composition.\n","date":1679356800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679356800,"objectID":"34da234ef3e96633befe4b4de9cd2393","permalink":"https://dkucharc.github.io/academic/projects/spectral_unmixing/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic/projects/spectral_unmixing/","section":"projects","summary":"Linear unmixing is a popular technique used for analyzing hyperspectral data.

It involves decomposing a matrix into two or more matrices that represent latent features or factors.\nThe goal of matrix factorization is to extract meaningful latent factors from a matrix that can be used to make predictions or recommendations. For example, in collaborative filtering, matrix factorization can be used to predict a user’s rating for an item based on their historical ratings and the ratings of similar users.\nMatrix factorization techniques are widely used in recommender systems to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their historical behavior or preferences. Here are some popular matrix factorization techniques used for recommender systems:\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD): SVD is a widely used matrix factorization technique for recommender systems. It decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into two lower-rank matrices, which represent latent factors. These factors represent the user’s preferences and the item’s characteristics.\nAlternating Least Squares (ALS): ALS is another popular matrix factorization technique for recommender systems. It iteratively minimizes the error between the original matrix and the reconstructed matrix using alternating optimization techniques.\nNon-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF): NMF is a matrix factorization technique that factorizes the user-item interaction matrix into two non-negative matrices, which represent the user preferences and item characteristics. It is often used for recommender systems that require non-negative values.\nBayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR): BPR is a matrix factorization technique that learns latent factors for users and items by maximizing the likelihood of the observed interactions while minimizing the likelihood of unobserved interactions.\nFactorization Machines (FM): FM is a matrix factorization technique that can capture complex interactions between user preferences and item characteristics. It is a more powerful technique than SVD or NMF, but it requires more computational resources.\nThese techniques have different strengths and weaknesses and can be used depending on the specific needs of the recommender system.\n","date":1679356800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679356800,"objectID":"1a5996d22e6b17de55d741b1a7922f9a","permalink":"https://dkucharc.github.io/academic/projects/20222023_factorization_machines/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic/projects/20222023_factorization_machines/","section":"projects","summary":"Matrix factorization is a popular technique in machine learning used for dimensionality reduction, data compression, and collaborative filtering.

The goal of index tracking is to achieve returns that closely match the performance of the chosen index, which is considered to be a benchmark for the overall market.\nIndex tracking is typically achieved through passive investing, which involves buying and holding the constituent securities of the index in proportion to their weights in the index. This approach allows investors to benefit from the growth of the overall market without having to make individual stock selections.\nThere are several advantages to index tracking. First, it offers broad exposure to a diversified portfolio of securities, which can reduce the risk of losses due to individual stock performance. Second, it typically has lower fees and expenses compared to actively managed funds, which can improve the overall returns for investors.

The test will take place during the tutorials, around the 9th week of the classes. The maximum number of points to be scored at the test is 70 points. The exam will take place at the end of the term, during the exam session. The maximum number of points to be scored at the exam is also 70 points. Evert student have an obligation to solve at least one problem from the official problem lists. This form of scoring points is called in-class activity. For each completely solved problem, a student can score 10 points. The problem is considered to be fully solved when the following requirements are met: the solution is correct, the solution is presented during the classes, the presented solution has to be delivered in the LaTeX format to the tutor’s email. The provided LaTeX file is meant to be based on the following template. A student cannot score more than a total of 70 points from the test and from in-class activity. Scoring 70 points that way frees the student from the obligation of taking a written part of the exam and guarantees him/her the final 5.0 grade in advance. Students being graded below 70 points (from the test and from in-class activity) have an obligation to take an exam. The final grade from the class is given in reference to the sum of the scores achieved from test, the in-class activity and the exam and it can derived from the table given below. Points Grade \u0026lt; 65 2.0 [65;80) 3.0 [80;90) 3.5 [90;105) 4.0 [105;120) 4.5 \u0026lt;= 120 5.0 Note: There is a possibility of getting an excellent (5.5) grade.
