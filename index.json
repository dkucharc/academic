Zbigniew Palmowski, DSc, PhD Audience: Students of Applied Mathematics, Faculty of Pure and Applied Mathematics (W-13), 1st semestr Time and place of the classes\nFridays, 9:15 AM - 11:00 AM (Building C-19, Room: A.1.3) Fridays, 11:15 AM - 1:00 PM (Building C-19, Room: A.1.3) Grading rules\nDuring the term there will be one test and one exam. The test will take place during the tutorials, around the 9th week of the classes. The maximum number of points to be scored at the test is 70 points. The exam will take place at the end of the term, during the exam session. The maximum number of points to be scored at the exam is also 70 points. Evert student have an obligation to solve at least one problem from the official problem lists. This form of scoring points is called in-class activity. For each completely solved problem, a student can score 10 points. The problem is considered to be fully solved when the following requirements are met: the solution is correct, the solution is presented during the classes, the presented solution has to be delivered in the LaTeX format to the tutor‚Äôs email. The provided LaTeX file is meant to be based on the following template. A student cannot score more than a total of 70 points from the test and from in-class activity. Scoring 70 points that way frees the student from the obligation of taking a written part of the exam and guarantees him/her the final 5.0 grade in advance. Students being graded below 70 points (from the test and from in-class activity) have an obligation to take an exam. The final grade from the class is given in reference to the sum of the scores achieved from test, the in-class activity and the exam and it can derived from the table given below. Points Grade \u0026lt; 65 2.0 [65;80) 3.0 [80;90) 3.5 [90;105) 4.0 [105;120) 4.5 \u0026lt;= 120 5.0 Note: There is a possibility of getting an excellent (5.5) grade. People aiming to get it will be asked to take an extra (oral) part of the exam. A willingness to take the exam should be accepted by the Tutor and reported to the Lecturer, accordingly.
