Semantic segmentation in remote sensing refers to the process of segmenting an image obtained from a remote sensing platform (such as a satellite or drone) into different regions or objects based on their semantic meaning. This involves assigning each pixel in the image to a particular class or category, such as vegetation, water, buildings, roads, and so on.

It has many applications, such as land cover classification, urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. It can be performed using a variety of techniques, including supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, and image processing techniques.

Some popular deep learning models used for semantic segmentation in remote sensing include U-Net, FCN, SegNet, and DeepLab. These models use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from the input image and then apply a decoder to generate a pixel-wise segmentation map.
