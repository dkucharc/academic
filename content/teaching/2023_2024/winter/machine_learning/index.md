**Course Summary**
---
This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning and statistical pattern recognition with the main focus on the deep learning methods.

**Time and Location**

Winter Term, 2023/2024

Thursday 1:15 PM - 3:00 PM, *C13, A.1.13*

**Grading & Rules**
- The course is divided into two streams. Namely, in-class lectures and labs.
- In total, a student can obtain up to **50** points. 
- The maximum number of points that can be achieved for labs is **34** points. 
- A student can get additional **16** points from the oral exam that will take place during the examination session.
- To obtain a positive mark it is sufficient and necessary to obtain at least **25** points
total. Then, the final grade is calculated as follows:
| <div style="width:140px"> POINTS </div> 	| <div style="width:140px"> GRADE </div> 	|
|:---:	|:---:	|
| [25, 30) 	| 3.0 	|
| [30, 35)  	| 3.5 	|
| [35, 40) 	| 4.0 	|
| [40, 45) 	| 4.5 	|
| [45, 50] 	| 5.0 	|
