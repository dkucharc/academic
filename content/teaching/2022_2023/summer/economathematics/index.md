**Basic information**
- Form of the classes: tutorials
- Lecturer: [prof. Zbigniew Palmowski, DSc, PhD](http://prac.im.pwr.wroc.pl/~zpalma)
- Audience: Students of Applied Mathematics, Faculty of Pure and Applied Mathematics (W-13), 1<sup>st</sup> semestr

**Time and place of the classes**
- Fridays, 9:15 AM - 11:00 AM (Building C-19, Room: A.1.3)
- Fridays, 11:15 AM - 1:00 PM (Building C-19, Room: A.1.3)

**Grading rules**
- During the term there will be one **test** and one **exam**.
- The **test** will take place during the tutorials, around the 9<sup>th</sup> week of the classes. The maximum number of points to be scored at the test is 70 points.
- The **exam** will take place at the end of the term, during the exam session. The maximum number of points to be scored at the exam is also 70 points.
- Evert student have an obligation to solve **at least one problem** from the official [problem lists](http://prac.im.pwr.wroc.pl/~zpalma/econ.html). This form of scoring points is called **in-class activity**.
- For each completely solved problem, a student can score 10 points. The problem is considered to be fully solved when the following requirements are met:
  - the solution is correct, 
  - the solution is presented during the classes,
  - the presented solution has to be delivered in the [`LaTeX`](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) format to the [tutor's email](mailto:daniel.kucharczyk[at]pwr.edu.pl). 
  The provided `LaTeX` file is meant to be based on the following [template](files/assignment_template.tex). 
- A student cannot score more than a total of **70** points from the **test** and from **in-class activity**. Scoring **70 points** that way frees the student from the obligation of taking a written part of the exam and guarantees him/her the final **5.0** grade in advance.  
- Students being graded below **70** points (from the **test** and from **in-class activity**) have an obligation to take an exam. 
The final grade from the class is given in reference to the **sum** of the scores achieved from **test**, the **in-class activity** and the **exam** and it can derived from the table given below.
</br>
| Points  | Grade |
  |:---------:|:--:|
  | < 65    | 2.0 |
  | [65;80) | 3.0 |
  | [80;90) | 3.5 |
  | [90;105) | 4.0 |
  | [105;120) | 4.5 |
  | <= 120 | 5.0 | 
</br>
  **Note**: There is a possibility of getting an excellent (5.5) grade. People aiming to get it will be asked to take an extra (oral) part of the exam. A willingness to take the exam should be accepted by the Tutor and reported to the Lecturer, accordingly.
